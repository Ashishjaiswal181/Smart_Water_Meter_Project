# Smart_Water_Meter_Project

This is a project that I worked with my friends from college for the _India Innovation Challenge Design_.
We qualified for the second reound but didn't make it to the final implementation round.
The project was designed to safeguard proper utilisation the water consumption and monetizing the water consumption.
The generated revenue to be used by government to provide water to the water scarce area. 
The design included smart water meter and sensors that would monitor the amount of water intake and usages and generate the bill based on 
the economical billing system.
